Here I share my [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/quiver-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=8&at=1l3v8Qy) notes and code snippets. 

Quiver is a closed source application which nevertheless stores all content in a plain text format (JSON), which at least makes it possible to version control snippets (a must).

Fortunately, there's even an iOS companion app available: [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-take-better-notes/id977882194](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-take-better-notes/id977882194?mt=8&at=1l3v8Qy)

Snippets are available for the following topics:
  * Git
  * Java
  * Go
  * Python
  * iOS
  * Red Hat products
  * OS basics
