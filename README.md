Here I share my [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/app/quiver-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=12) notes and code snippets. Quiver is a closed source application which nevertheless stores all content in a plain text format (IIUC JSON), which at least makes it possible to version control snippets (a must for me).

Unfortunately there's no iOS companion app available.
